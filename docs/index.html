            <h1> About </h1>
                <p> 
I am Lieke de Mare, a first year graduate students Industrial design student at the Technical University of Eindhoven. Outside my studies I am active at the scouting, other hobbies include photography and tinkering.

As an industrial designer, I want to improve healthcare by contributing a human-centered design view to the development of products and systems which don’t only have care efficiency but also care experience, as core value.

Vision as designer
                    </h2> 
                    <p> 
As a designer I want to develop human-centered products and systems in healthcare which are able to support patients and caregivers in improving their quality of life, by providing a bridge between the medical needs and the human needs. For example, in the case for this project, a physician might require a urine sample, but current methods are perceived as inefficient and uncomfortable. Then a system could be designed that better fits in the workflow of the nurses and that is less uncomfortable to the older adult but still gets the urine sample with the same of even better quality.
In my vision the strength of good design, whether it is a product, service or both, is that it is not only there to reach a certain goal but that it also focuses on the experience. Design can make people feel empowered when they are able to do something themselves that they were not able to do before, it can be motivating when invisible progress is made visible, and it can provide relief, when a difficult task is made easier. To provide these experiences I find it important to design from a human-centered perspective, in which the physical, mental and cognitive needs of the user, and other stakeholders, are taken into account and in which the design is placed in the context of use. To get an understanding of the needs of the users and stakeholders it is important to use empathic design. By talking to users, stakeholders and experts throughout the process, and to possibly even involve the target group into co-design sessions, a system can be made most successful. As it makes sure the system fits both the medical requirements and the stakeholders needs best.

Identity as designer
                    </h2>
                    <p> 
Although I want to design with human factors taken into account I don’t see myself completely user focused, because in case of design in healthcare there are many standpoints to deal with. Products need to be viable, this means they should be effective, which could lead into decisions having to be made that might not be in line with the wishes of the user. Research is very important to me while I see the necessity of it to make a great viable design. In healthcare you can not only listen to the wishes of the user, you need to know some of the medical background. Also research and benchmarking helps to understand what is already known to avoid making mistakes that have already been made, what does work and what doesn’t work and it can give information I couldn’t get myself due to privacy or ethical considerations.
